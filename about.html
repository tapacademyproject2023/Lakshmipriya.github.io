    <h1>Who We are?</h1>
    <p>Launched in 2010, Our technology platform connects customers, restaurant partners and delivery partners, serving their multiple needs. Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, read and write customer generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make payments while dining-out at restaurants. On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business while also providing a reliable and efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners. We also provide our delivery partners with transparent and flexible earning opportunities. </p>

   <h3> The business benefits of having more women working in warehouses and dark stores</h3>
   <p> We want to make Zomato a place that provides equitable access to opportunities for all genders. We want to be a sustainable company that the nation, and equally importantly, our parents will be proud of, in how we help in creating a better society. As part of this effort, we have been introducing more women workers into different parts of our business, so our efforts at creating meaningful opportunities for women do not stop within the confines of our offices.

    We have already onboarded over 2,000 women delivery partners into our food delivery fleet and will continue to work hard to multiply that number. Another crucial area where we see opportunity to create roles for women is in our warehouses and dark stores, housed within our Hyperpure and Blinkit businesses. Here are some learnings as we start introducing women workers into supply chain jobs at these facilities</p>
<h3> How we incresed our Zomato Restaurant partner App Speed by over 90%</h3>
<p> At Zomato, we understand that the success of our platform hinges on delivering outstanding service to our customers, restaurant partners and delivery partners. To achieve this, we embarked on a transformative Android engineering journey with our Zomato Restaurant Partner App, focusing on optimizing performance, enhancing the overall user experience, and bolstering app stability.We are deeply committed to providing a seamless experience through our restaurant partner app, that enables our restaurant partners to efficiently handle incoming orders, streamline operations and have an elevated user experience with Zomato.</p>
